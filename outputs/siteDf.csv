The lakeside forest has a dense canopy and is dominated by Pseudotsuga menziesii. Other important overstory species include Pinus lambertiana, Chamaecyparis lawsoniana, Calocedrus decurrens, Pinus jeffreyi, and Chrysolepis. A small stand of Tsuga heterophylla is found adjacent to the site. Rhododendron macrophyllum is a common understory shrub, while Quercus sadleriana occupies the understory adjacent to canopy gaps. Aquatic vegetation in the lake is dominated by Nuphar polysepela and Sparganium angustifolium, while Carex grow on the moist lake margin.

The mountains are composed predominantly of granite with contact aureole schists at the margins. The steep sided valley was deepened by glacial activity during the last glaciation (Coxon et al. 2012). The valley is flooded by two lakes which are separated by an alluvial fan deposited by a stream flowing down the centre of the southern wall of the valley. The Lower Lake (Irish Grid ref: T 118 966; Long. 06˚20’30”W Lat. 53˚00’30”N) is bounded on its western margin by the alluvial fan, the north and south margins are the steep valley sides and the eastern margin at the mouth of the valley is formed by a delta derived from an earlier lake that filled the valley (Coxon et al. 2012). The Upper Lake flows into the Lower Lake via a river that has cut through the fan deposit. The Lower Lake is approximately 300 m long (east-west) and 150 m wide (north-south); water depth is 13 m at its deepest point. The Lower Lake lies at an altitude of 130 m OD. The valley walls are now covered by semi-natural oak woods and plantations of exotic conifers which open out onto mountain heathland at higher altitudes. During the last century, mining activity led to the lowering of the water level in the Lower Lake by two metres (Anon 1990). The coring site was on the western margin of the Lower Lake. This was in the shore zone that is seasonally flooded. Due to the lowering of the water level in the last century, the sediments were lacustrine (rather than alluvial fan) deposits and were overlain by peat.",0.0837700000000003,0.0206500000000034,"Glendalough","Core","GL","pollen",7382,"Maldonado, J","2020-02-20","Last submission to Neotoma","Alnus",NA,"Betulaceae","A","IRL",1,2,"Adm-0 country",151,"Ireland","IRL",0,2,"Sovereign country","Ireland","IRL",0,"Ireland","IRL",0,"Ireland","IRL","Ireland","Ire.","IRL",NA,NA,"Ireland",2,4203200,188400,0,"IE","IRL",372,"IRL",-8.13763988410812,53.1763487137152,"IRL","Ireland","Europe","Eurasia","Europe","Western Europe","Western Europe","Europe","Europe","OECD90","Western Europe (WEU)","Europe, Western",25,"Europe","other","other","other"
